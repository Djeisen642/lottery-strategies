# Lottery Strategies

This is just for fun. Running it, you'll see that there's no statistically significant difference between the winning strategies and the losing ones

This was built with the help of Gemini Cloud Code in VS Code.

Includes the following strategies:

- RandomStrategy - Always pick a random number
- PreviousNumberStrategy - Always pick the previous number
- MostUsedNumberStrategy - Always pick the most used number
- LeastUsedNumberStrategy - Always pick the least used number
- StaticNumberStrategy - Never change your number
- IncrementStrategy - Always pick a number 1 greater than your last number
